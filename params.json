Those few, however, are primarily focused on large-scale, covariate shift, or concept drift performance. \r\n\r\nIn contrast, we propose an anomaly detection challenge for data with complex dependency structure. For that, we provide a benchmark dataset for detection of years of heavy crop yield loss in India, based upon freely available statistics. Here, anomaly detection methods are forced to leverage the inter-dependency structure of measurements. \r\n\r\nWe describe each step of the _non-trivial_ dataset construction process in detail and further, propose an anomaly detection challenge.\r\nIn a series of experiments we examine the dataset and provide some baseline benchmarks based on a variety of supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised machine learning methods. We invite researchers to participate and share their results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Data\r\nData can be aquired at http://...\r\nand should contain the following: \r\n- WDATA (548, 11284, 6)\r\n['Max Temperature' 'Min Temperature' 'Precipitation' 'Wind' 'Relative Humidity' 'Solar']\r\n- DATES (11284, 3)\r\n['Day' 'Month' 'Year']\r\n- STATIONS (548, 4)\r\n['Id' 'Longitude' 'Latitude' 'Elevation']\r\n- DISTS (93, 5)\r\n['DistCode' 'DistName' 'StateCode' 'StateName' 'StationIds']\r\n- LABEL (93, 31)\r\n[1979 - 2009]\r\n\r\n### Results\r\ntoo appear...\r\n\r\n### References\r\nWhen using the data or results in your research project, please cite _too appear_",
